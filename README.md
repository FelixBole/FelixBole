## Hey: a quick introduction

My experience has 2 sides to it, since this is GitHub, let's start with the development one.

### Developer experience

I am currently the CTO of [Visions](https://github.com/VisionsOfficial)

I am also building a game as an indie game developer. The game is made under Unity and C# and is a project on which I work on development, game design, UX/UI, sound and music.

#### `Dev work`

- 🔭 I’m currently working at Visions on a consent based personnal data intermediary. Building tools in a MERN stack.
- 🌐 I'm an active member of [Prometheus-X](https://github.com/Prometheus-X-association) and leading the development of various Open Source Building Blocks within the association.
- 🪐 [Personal website](https://felixbole.com) A React website running on an express server which presents me a little better - 2023
- 🔴 I made a bunch of small libraries, both for web development and Unity, some of which are on NPM, others, on my github
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about C# (Unity)

### Sound & Music

Most of my life's experience evolves around sound and music. I've been a musician since I was 2 years old and have been making music ever since.

My initial studies were at EICAR, a cinema school. I graduated a Bachelor in Sound and have been continuing to make music, sound, sound engineering and sound recording as a freelancer ever since. 

#### `Music`

- 🎼 I've released a game/film music album called [Journey](https://felixbole.bandcamp.com/album/journey)
- 🔭 I’m currently working on the sound and music for the game I am building
- 🎹 I've toured with a French band called Le Horla as a pianist and guitarist, and got to be finalist of the Emergenza french tremplin
